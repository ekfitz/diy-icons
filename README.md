# diy icons
 basic navigation icons in css

Starting with a hamburger menu. In html and css. Later try in JS

For the hamburger, the id is "hamburger". Set the style of this.

All class is "hamnav". Set the color and opacity of this.

Scratch that, changing the lines to the class name to easily change their style. The whole does not have a class name.

Probably going to style icon by id rather than class
